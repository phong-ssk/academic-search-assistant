This study investigated how factors influencing the use of an intranet folder system (IFS) providing evidence-based guidelines change during the transition to a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS). A two-wave survey was conducted among nursing staff at a Swiss hospital, assessing system utilisation, Evidence-Based Nursing (EBN) related factors, selected variables from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and demographic information. Structural equation modelling was applied to identify key determinants of utilisation. Facilitating Conditions and Social Influence significantly influenced utilisation in both systems. EBN factors, specifically Trust and Knowledge, impacted Effort Expectancy only in the CDSS model. These results suggest that while organisational and social factors consistently promote system use, the successful adoption of a CDSS additionally requires the development of new trust in the technology and expanded knowledge of its functions to reduce perceived effort and enhance utilisation. The findings highlight the need for structural support, social endorsement, and targeted training to facilitate the effective implementation of CDSS in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Background: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is essential for quality healthcare. Nurse managers (NMs) play a key role in promoting EBP adoption among nurses, given their position as clinical leaders for nurses seeking to change practice. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the factors influencing their understanding and facilitation of EBP in care delivery. Aim: To synthesize literature on the enablers and barriers faced by NMs in understanding, using, and facilitating EBP within acute care settings. Methods: A scoping review which followed the Joanna Briggs Institute framework for scoping reviews and reported in accordance with PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. Multiple electronic databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus, JBI EBP database, Embase, Emcare, HMIC, and PsycINFO regardless of publication to be comprehensive. Two independent reviewers screened studies and extracted data. Methodological quality of included studies was appraised and considered high. Results: The search yielded 1338 results of which 24 studies met inclusion criteria and included in the review. Key findings are the central role of strong personal factors-such as positive attitudes, beliefs, and good EBP competencies-in driving understanding and use of EBP. Supportive leadership behaviors can create a positive organizational environment for EBP, while access to resources and infrastructure are essential for EBP implementation. Conversely, barriers such as poor EBP knowledge, skills and competency, heavy workloads, insufficient resources, and lack of effective leadership support impede EBP implementation within acute care settings. Conclusions: NMs play a crucial role in EBP implementation within their organizations, emphasizing the interconnectedness of personal and organizational factors. Implications for Nursing management: Developing key personal factors and specific EBP-supportive behaviors of NMs can create a powerful catalyst for overcoming barriers, leading to improved patient care outcomes.",

Their purpose is to enable healthcare providers and patients to make the best decisions regarding healthcare interventions associated with a particular clinical condition, considering each patient's specific circumstances. One element that has gained importance recently is considering patient preferences when developing healthcare recommendations to increase adherence to therapeutic measures and patient satisfaction. One way to incorporate these preferences is by including patients or their representatives in developing these tools. Patient participation can take place through their inclusion as members of the development panel and/or at different stages of the guideline development process. This can be achieved through various methods like discussion groups, semi-structured interviews, or surveys. However, challenges still need to be addressed to optimally incorporate patients' perspectives, which, among other reasons, are related to socioeconomic barriers, educational gaps, and the persistence of a paternalistic view of healthcare.

Participants were healthcare professionals working in inpatient ABI rehabilitation and external stakeholders working with patients with ABI post-discharge. Triangulation of data and methods (audits, surveys, focus groups) were employed to provide a comprehensive analysis of barriers and their causes. Results A total of 47 healthcare professionals (70% female) and 14 external stakeholders (71% female) participated. Factors negatively impacting on discharge were classified as pre-disposing (inconsistent planning, limited staff knowledge of discharge goals), enabling (accommodation and funding) and reinforcing (communication, family, nursing involvement). Suggested facilitators for coordinated discharge included clear and consistent communication, support for patient-family emotional adjustment to disability and discharge plans, and improved early access to funding schemes. Conclusion Theory-informed and collaborative methods led to recommendations including a discharge pathway and checklist, meetings with clear objectives for discharge discussions, and an increase in family and nursing staff involvement to improve discharge processes.",

      "abstract": "Research on the outcomes of veterinary treatments in dogs, cats and horses has important benefits for these animals and their owners. However, this information is not always available, and the evidence base is often lower-quality than in human medicine. To identify ways to improve the generation of evidence, we investigated the views of veterinary professionals about research involving companion animal patients and their owners. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with veterinary surgeons and registered veterinary nurses working in UK companion animal clinical practice. Interviews were conducted with 20 veterinary professionals from different clinical settings including both those with and without previous experience of research involving animals. Analyses revealed that veterinary professionals valued evidence-based information to help them make informed decisions about treatment with owners. However, there was often not enough available evidence. Veterinary professionals were willing to help produce this research evidence. However, lack of time and resources were key challenges and in addition, they did not always feel they had the necessary research skills, experience and support. Some participants also found it difficult to discuss participation in research with owners of their veterinary patients. They also had concerns about the amount and type of extra information they would need to give to owners. Veterinary professionals also faced a dilemma as their key role is to protect the welfare of animals that they treat, yet felt that there was the potential for some animals assigned to receive a specific treatment as part of a research study to be disadvantaged. Companion animal research has important benefits for veterinary patients, their owners and for veterinary professionals. Based on our findings, more funding, improved research training, resources, support networks and changes to current regulations are needed. Improved evidence would assist veterinary professionals and owners when making informed decisions around veterinary care.",

Tuy nhiên, thực trạng khởi nghiệp của Việt Nam đang gặp vấn đề rất lớn trong việc duy trì và vận hành doanh nghiệp sau khi thành lập. Nguyên nhân xuất phát từ ý định khởi nghiệp chưa được duy trì hiệu quả. Do đó, mục tiêu của nghiên cứu là dựa vào lý thuyết hành vi có kế hoạch (TPB) để tìm hiểu vai trò của nhận thức kiểm soát hành vi (PBC) và định hướng khởi nghiệp (EO) trong việc củng cố ý định khởi nghiệp (EI) của sinh viên đại học. Phương pháp định lượng được áp dụng dựa trên việc sử dụng kỹ thuật PLS-SEM để phân tích bộ dữ liệu sơ cấp bao gồm 371 quan sát được thu thập thông qua chiến lược chọn mẫu thuận tiện. Kết quả nghiên cứu đã cung cấp bằng chứng về tác động của PBC đối với EI thông qua vai trò trung gian của EO. Bên cạnh đó, kết quả này bổ sung vào khung phân tích lý thuyết ý định hành vi khởi nghiệp và khẳng định tính chất quan trọng của EO trong việc củng cố nhận thức cá nhân về năng lực bản thân. Các phân tích về kết quả này mang đến hiểu biết sâu hơn về cách mà sinh viên chủ động phát triển tư duy và củng cố sự hiểu biết về khả năng kiểm soát hành vi khởi nghiệp.",
