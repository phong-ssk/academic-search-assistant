      "abstract": "Given the metabolic interplay between glucose and uric acid, individuals should proactively monitor and be alert of elevated levels of both substances. For the first time, this paper describes a novel design of electrochemical biosensor based on screen-printed electrode of a single channel but capable of simultaneously measuring blood glucose and uric acid concentrations. Experimental results demonstrated that this single-channel biosensor exhibits good performance towards glucose and uric acid, such as broad linear range, good reproducibility, good stability, and strong resistance against interference. For spiked recovery experiments on human venous blood samples, the glucose recovery rate ranged from 95.9 % to 103.2 %, while the uric acid recovery rate ranged from 99.7 % to 104.9 %. And the relative standard deviation for both parameters was less than 5 %, indicating that this biosensor holds promising prospects for commercial application. This is truly the first time that enable simultaneous detection of glucose and uric acid concentrations using just one drop of blood and a single test strip. It reduces the number of blood draws required, lowers analysis costs, and significantly improves screening efficiency for individuals with diabetes and hyperuricemia."

      "abstract": "N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) is an important biomarker that indicates early renal tubular damage. Its activity level in urine has been widely used for early detection and monitoring of chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly diabetic nephropathy. However, current detection methods rely on complex instrumentation, which hinders their suitability for point-of-care testing (POCT) that requires portability and user-friendliness. To address this challenge, we developed a sequential dual-reagent paper-based analytical device (SeDR-PAD) that utilizes structural partitioning and a delayed-trigger mechanism to achieve time-programmed control of the NAG enzymatic reaction and color development process. The system uses VRA-GlcNAc as the substrate to generate a chromogen under the catalysis of NAG. A portable device then releases an alkaline catalyst after a programmed delay to initiate color development, followed by optical quantitative analysis. This method provides a linear detection range of 0-200 U/L, with a detection limit of 0.524 U/L and high reproducibility (CV < 6%, n = 5). In a methodological comparison involving 70 clinical urine samples, the SeDR-PAD platform demonstrated strong concordance with the standard clinical method, with a correlation coefficient R2 of 0.9833. These findings highlight the strong potential of SeDR-PAD for clinical POCT of uNAG in individuals at high risk for kidney disease."
