      "abstract": "Abstract&#xD;&#xD;Dosimetric biomarkers, in terms of dosiomics features, play a crucial role in modeling radiotherapy and should be analyze d for their robustness and stability. This study aims to investigate how these dosiomics features will change over variations in treatment planning parameters. Different treatment plans were created by varying such parameters as field number, dose calculation algorithm, dose grid resolution, energy, monitor units, fraction, dose, field size, multileaf collimator, collimator angle, table angle, source-to-surface distance and source-to-axis distance, and wedge for a hypothetical tumor in the CIRS phantom CT scan. Dosiomics features were extracted with different segment sizes. The coefficient of variation (COV) was used to evaluate dosiomics feature changes with consider COV ≤ 5% as robust features.&#xD;Our findings showed that many of the dosiomics features had significant variations due to changes in treatment parameters. First-order and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features were more stable (COV ≤ 5%) compared to others. Field and wedge changes had the most significant impact on features, while the dose calculation algorithm, dose, and MU changes had the lesser effects. Dosiomics features were vulnerable over changing treatment parameters and should always be reported. The GLCM features set was the most robust. Further studies are needed to identify robust dosiomics features for future biomarker discovery.&#xD."

      "abstract": "Hybrid immune individuals who experience an infection after a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccine series show evidence of salivary anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgA antibodies with broad specificity against different variants. It is unclear how long these antibodies persist and whether they offer protection against new SARS-CoV-2 infections. We compared salivary IgA levels to full-length spike protein and its RBD of the ancestral Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Omicron BA.1 variant in a subset of persons participating in a longitudinal study of binding antibody responses to vaccination. We assessed the decay rate of the salivary IgA antibodies in those with hybrid immunity. In our heavily vaccinated population, low levels of salivary IgA to RBD and spike was variably detected in vaccine-only immunity to both Wuhan and Omicron BA.1, but antibody levels were an order of magnitude higher in those with hybrid immunity. In hybrid immune individuals, anti-spike/RBD salivary IgA rapidly decayed over a 4-month observation period. In a multivariate analysis, salivary IgA antibody to Omicron BA.1 was not associated with protection from a new SARS-CoV-2 infection over the subsequent 10 months during the Omicron XBB.1.5, EG.5, and JN waves of infection. In contrast, receipt of a new vaccine dose was significantly associated with protection."

      "abstract": "Although messenger RNA (mRNA) technology revolutionized vaccine creation, its use is threatened by unwarranted fear that DNA left over from the vaccine manufacturing process could integrate into recipients' DNA, increasing cancer and heritable risks. Drawing on the mental model theory of reasoning, our two preregistered interventions undercut these problematic conclusions. They do so by testing the effectiveness of two mental model-based interventions juxtaposing problematic claims with visualized or verbally explained models of basic biological and vaccination systems. Study 1: a) graphically modeled how mRNA COVID-19 vaccination works (Model 1); b) verbally modeled ways in which cells protect themselves from foreign DNA (Model 2); and c) provided ancillary material designed to bolster perceptions of mRNA vaccination safety. Study 2 deployed an animation of the cell-protection model (Model 2), alone, and in combination with Study 1's messaging. Neither the mRNA vaccine nor the DNA protection model explicitly acknowledged the problematic DNA-integration claim. Both preemptive (before) and rebuttal (after) positioning of the models were effective. Within-person analyses suggested that preemptive positioning may be somewhat more effective than rebuttal positioning. Some positive effects of exposure to the modeled knowledge messaging condition in Study 1 persisted 2 mo after exposure."

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic triggered unprecedented challenges to the clinical education of healthcare students. Although alternative clinical placements were developed and introduced, it is unclear whether students successfully acquired interprofessional competencies required to be collaborative practice-ready healthcare workers. We examined interprofessional collaboration competency acquisition from adapted and alternative clinical placements that were made available to pre-qualification healthcare students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information searches from online databases and supplementary sources identified 20 articles that met criteria. Student perceptions indicate that these alternative placements supported the learning of interprofessional collaboration competencies. Outcomes mapped against the updated Canadian Interprofessional Health Collaborative Competency Framework indicate that the most frequently reported interprofessional collaboration competency was team communication and the least reported were collaborative leadership and team differences/disagreements processing. Although gains in interprofessional collaboration competencies were reported across the studies, their methodological shortcomings make it difficult to determine whether alternative placements (e.g. online and telephone-based) were better or comparable to traditional placements (i.e. with face-to-face interactions), for interprofessional collaboration competency development. These findings suggest the need for further research assessing the effectiveness and sustainability of alternative placement models. A greater understanding of clinical placement alternatives could inform educational practices in future pandemics or other unprecedented events."
